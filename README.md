# Scoop

This is my Final Capstone Project for Nashville Software School. It is due May 18th, 2018, so it will not be completed until around that time. I will slowly be pushing up new updates to this project. 
I plan to use NodeJS and React.

## Goals:
1. Build a webscraper using NodeJS to pull price data off of a popular used music gear website. 
2. Save user "watchlists" to a database with item description and average prices. 
3. Listen to listings posted for watchlist items on the website and compare their prices to the average price for that item.
4. If the listed price of the new listing is lower than the average price for that item, then my app will send a notification to the user to let them know that a good deal is available, and there will be a link to that item. 
5. The main 2 pages of the app will be as follows:
  a. Watchlist items all listed on one page with the best deal available and the average price of that item shown. There will only be one product block per watched list item on this page. 
  b. A list of "scoops", which is a page that ONLY shows items that below a certain price threshold. This page will be the main focus of the app. Its purpose will be to show only a few of the very best deals available on the site, filtered by their watchlist.
  
## Post-mvp:
1. A "feed" page that lists all of the best deals for all the watched items the user has, sorted in order by the best deal available. There can be multiple product blocks for each watchlist item on this page. 
2. User settings where they can change which "page" displays upon opening the app.
